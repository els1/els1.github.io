          position in Theoretical Astrochemistry</h2>
        
        <p> A graduate position (at the M.Sc. or Ph.D. level) in computational astrochemistry 
          is available at Western University (Canada) with a nominal starting date of 
          September 2022, under the joint supervision of Prof. Viktor N. Staroverov 
          (Department of Chemistry) and Profs. Jan Cami and Els Peeters (Department of 
          Physics & Astronomy).  </p>
          
        <p> <b>Project description:</b> The Universe is aglow with the infrared emission 
          of large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
          and fullerenes. Their emission encodes a large amount of information about the 
          physical and chemical environments in which they reside and is a powerful messenger 
          which can be used to study large-scale astrophysical processes such as star and 
          planet formation, as well as galaxy evolution. The interpretation of these 
          astronomical observations requires theoretically generated PAH spectra in conjunction 
          with astronomical models of PAH evolution. This is particularly important and timely, 
          given the imminent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in December 2021. 
          Hailed as the bigger and vastly more sensitive successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, 
          JWST will allow researchers to process and analyze observations of unprecedented 
          quality in order to study the Universe both near and far. Many JWST observations 
          will be dominated by this emission due to large molecules. The goal of this project 
          is to devise and carry out systematic theoretical simulations of PAH spectra relevant 
          to the interpretation of JWST observations of diverse astronomical objects.  </p>

        <p> <b>Requirements:</b> A B.Sc. or M.Sc. degree or equivalent in Chemistry, 
          Astronomy, Astrophysics, or related fields, with a background in computational 
          chemistry and/or quantum physics, and demonstrated experience in scientific programming. 
          Further information is available 
          <a href="https://physics.uwo.ca/graduate/future_students/index.html">here</a>; to 
          apply for this position, start 
          <a href="https://physics.uwo.ca/graduate/future_students/how_to_apply.html">here</a>. </p>
          
          <p> Application received before February 1, 2022 will receive full consideration.</p>

        <p> <b>Contact:</b> Interested candidates are encouraged to contact Prof. Els Peeters
        for more information regarding the application process.
